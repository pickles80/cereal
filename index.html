      A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components 
      of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis),
      composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown
      in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any 
      other type of crop[1] and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains
      from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa 
      (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.
In their natural form (as in whole grain), cereals are a rich source of
      vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, oils, and protein. When 
      refined by the removal of the bran and germ, the remaining endosperm
      is mostly carbohydrate. In some developing nations, grain in the form 
      of rice, wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. 
      In developed nations, cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still
      substantial. <br><br>
